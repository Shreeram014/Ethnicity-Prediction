Ethnicity Prediction
This project predicts ethnicity from facial images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

Dataset
The dataset used is the UTKFace dataset, which contains facial images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity. link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new

The project involves loading and preprocessing the UTKFace dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), extracting features from the images, and building and training a CNN to predict ethnicity based on the facial images.
